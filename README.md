## Crime rate prediction

Crime Prediction plays a crucial role in
addressing crime, violence, conflict and insecurity in cities to
promote good governance, appropriate urban planning and
management. Plenty effort shave been made on developing
crime prediction models by leveraging demographic data,
Linear model or K-means but they failed to capture the
dynamic nature of crimes in urban. However, for a city it is
hard to build a uniform framework for all boroughs due to the
uneven distribution of data. This project is about the study of
Crimes and provides the approach of security along with the
detection of those crimes. The Megalopolis protection is main
aspect of this project. This project proposed the approach for
predicting crimes using Python packages and is based on ANN
model. This project further exploits the spatio-temporal
patterns in urban data in one borough in a city, and then
leverages transfer learning techniques to reinforce the crime
prediction of other boroughs. Specifically, we first validate
the existence of spatio-temporal patterns in urban crime. Then
we extract the Crime related features from cross-domain
datasets. Finally, we propose a novel transfer learning
framework to integrate these features and model spatiotemporal patterns of Crime prediction
